# Final Project Scenario
You have been asked by the product catalog manager at your company to develop an Product microservice to build a catalog for your e-commerce website. The user interface (UI) has been developed by another team and will be used by product administrators to maintain the product catalog. Since it is a microservice, it is expected to have a well-formed REST API that the UI and other microservices can call. This service initially needs the ability to create, read, update, delete, and list products by various attributes.

You have also been informed that someone else has started on this project and has already developed the database model and a Python Flask-based REST API with an endpoint to create products. You will already have this code in your copy of the repository.

In the first part of this project you will use good Test Driven Development practices to create a REST API that allows users to Create, Read, Update, Delete, and List products by various attributes. As mentioned, the Create implementation and tests will be provided for you to use as an example for your code.

In the second part of this project you will write Behavior Driven Development scenarios to test that the administrative user interface, which has been provided for you, behaves as expected. The scenario for Create is already implemented. You will also need to write code to load the background data, and more scenarios to fill out the allowed actions.
